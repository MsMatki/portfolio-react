            <p>
              I am Bartol Bilankov a Front End Web Developer living in
              Manchester. Iâ€™m extremely passionate about Web Development and
              Design in all its forms, and the main reason is that Front-end
              development satisfies my need for creativity. It enabled me to
              easily put my ideas into digital form and get results back really
              quick.

              I still remember the first time I created an HTML page and opened
              it in the browser. A whole new world of possibilities appeared
              before my eyes. I became really passionate and kept creating since
              then. It absolutely has its ups and downs but if you love what you
              do and are able to provide value to people, the outcomes are far
              more rewarding! I love technology, enjoy creating a great user
              experience, and looking for an exciting career with a lot of
              growth potential. If you are a business seeking web presence or an
              employer loking to hire, you can get in touch with me here
